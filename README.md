Descriptions - This task focused on designing and developing the front-end of a basic E-Learning platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of the project was to create a styled, interactive, multi-page web interface that demonstrates how online learning platforms present courses, display video content, and track user progress. The application was developed using only front-end technologies and runs locally in a web browser without requiring any backend server.

The platform was structured as a multi-page website consisting of a course listing page, a course content page, and a progress tracking page. The home page displays available courses such as HTML Basics, CSS Styling, and JavaScript Introduction. Each course is presented inside a styled card layout with a button that allows users to navigate to the selected course. This page serves as the main entry point of the application and demonstrates basic navigation and layout design.

The course page contains embedded instructional video content using an iframe, allowing learners to watch tutorial videos directly within the platform. A “Mark Completed” button is provided to simulate course completion. When this button is clicked, JavaScript stores the completion status in the browser’s local storage. This approach enables basic state management on the front end without using a database, while still providing a realistic learning flow.

The progress tracking page visually represents the learner’s completion status using a progress bar. JavaScript retrieves the stored progress value from local storage and dynamically updates both the width of the progress bar and the displayed percentage. This demonstrates dynamic content rendering and client-side data handling. Together, these features simulate a simplified learning experience similar to real-world e-learning platforms.

CSS was used to style the entire interface, including headers, navigation menus, course cards, buttons, and progress indicators. Flexbox and consistent spacing were applied to maintain clean alignment, while color themes and padding improved readability and visual appeal. The layout was designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across different screen sizes. Navigation links at the top of each page allow seamless movement between courses and progress tracking, creating a smooth multi-page experience.

The project was intentionally implemented using simple tools such as Notepad for development and standard web browsers for execution. All files were saved as plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documents, making the platform easy to run locally by simply opening the main HTML file. This approach emphasizes fundamental front-end concepts without relying on frameworks or external libraries.

After development, the project was documented in a README file outlining the purpose, features, technologies used, and instructions for running the application. The complete project folder was uploaded to GitHub for version control and sharing. GitHub Pages was used to deploy the application, providing a live URL that allows others to access and review the platform online.

Overall, this task provided hands-on experience in building a structured front-end application with multiple pages, embedded media, and interactive elements. It strengthened understanding of HTML page organization, CSS styling, JavaScript-based interactivity, and basic progress tracking. The E-Learning platform serves as a practical demonstration of front-end development skills and showcases the ability to design user-friendly interfaces suitable for internship-level projects.
